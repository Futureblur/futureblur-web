# Version 2 üçâ
This version was published around the Summer of 2021. It was really fun to make, since I improved a lot ever since. <br>
I learned how to a website responsive and how to make a proper navbar. I kept the design very minimalistic and used only one accent color. <br>

## Which frameworks/langauges were used?
At that time, I never heard of any frameworks that would make my life easier. I coded everything from ground up using only three elements:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Yes, nothing more. It was quite painful to bind the HTML components to JS, but hey, it worked.

## What were the key features?
With each new version, I try to improve the last one:

- Responsive & Minimalist Web Design
- Contact form
- More content in the landing page (projects & skills section)
