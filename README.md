# Futureblur Web ðŸŒŽ
This repository contains the code for my [website](https://futureblur.com). Every version of the website has its own subtree.
Currently, we're at **V2** ðŸŒ , and I'm working on **V3** which will be released until the end of February.
These changes will massively overhaul the design as well as improve the user experience. You can click
